 Automation Test for the IndiHome Website

Hi yall! its me Again!

This time its just a simple assertion focus Automation that I made. 
I couldnt do more to this Web App becuase most of it needs the login feature which is blocked by Phone Verification :(
Yeaah I know it sucks but hope you guys like it!

Anyway, what you will need to run this code will be explained below:

    understanding of Java 6 and up (duh, lol)
    you can run this preferably on IntelliJ IDEA
    When you first download and open it, dont forget to reload all the Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file
    I havent made it so you can run on Terminal, but you can still Run in on the Test Files. just go to Java Class that has 'Tests' behind it and run it from there
    Cheers! and Have fun!
